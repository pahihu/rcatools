calc18 is a native compiler for a B-like language.
For a reference on B see https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/kbman.html

This implementation has the following limitations:
- unsigned arithmetic
- for << and >> the shift amount is modulo 256
- relational and logical operators return -1
- operator evaluation order is undefined
- no function pointers (yet)


Good luck!
