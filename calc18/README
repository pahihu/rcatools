calc18 is a native compiler for a B-like language.
For a reference on B see https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/kbman.html

This implementation has the following limitations:
- unsigned arithmetic
- for << and >> the shift count is mod 256
- the switch stmt is numeric, ie. it uses a jump table, the cases
  are restricted to mod 256
- function pointers should use parens: (lvalu)(arg1,...)
- pointer lvalues should use parens: *(lvalu) = rvalu
- external vector declarations cannot omit the vector size, use v[0]


Changes:
- *e is ASCII DC3
- case stmt can contain constant numeric expr, not just constants


Good luck!
