Limitations
===========
- unsigned arithmetic
- << and >> shifts with (shift amount % 256)
- relational and logical operators return -1
- operator evaluation order is undefined
- function argument expression evaluation is right to left
- no function pointers


TODO
====
? n << 8 is {LO(n),0}
? n >> 8 is {0,HI(n)}

- simplify code generator
- gdtoac() 1 instead of -1 ?
- fix operator evaluation order as arg0 op arg1
  1st evaluate arg0 then arg1
- n & 0377 is {0,LO(n)}
- n & 0177400 is {HI(n),0}
