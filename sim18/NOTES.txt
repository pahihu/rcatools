CDP1802 NOTES
=============

- M.Riley 512K memory expansion
  16K switched into $8000 - $BFFF
  external latch (5bits [or 8bit]) controlled by writing to any address from
  $C000 upwards.

  16K requires 14bits + 5bits latch => 19bits, 512K
                      + 8bits latch => 22bits, 4MB

- Lee Hart's Altaid8080 design

  It uses a 74HC251 multiplexer and a 74HC259 addressable latch. The 64K
  memory space is broken into 8K pages, and each page can be selected as
  RAM, ROM, or none. Bits in the addressable latch control bank-switching
  and select the upper address bits of up to 1 Mbyte of memory.

- AMSAT AO-40 IHU-1 (also on OSCAR 10, 13)
   AO-13 w/ 32K of memory, but never used more than 16K
   CDP-1802 w/ 16KB of memory, running at 100K instr/s
   NB. 100K = 10us / 2 MCLK, 1 MCLK = 5us, 1 CLK = 625ns => 1.6MHz

   TLM spec says 64K memory

   256byte  128 channel ADC
   128byte  IPS SYSPAGE
   telemetry transmit @ 400bps using PSK

   P3 block structure
   sync            4   #39 #15 #ED #30
   block         512
   CRCC            2
   inter-block  ~130  #50

   400bit/s = 50byte/s, 50Hz is the std rate for IPS sysclk and interrupts.

- disable interrupts on bootstrap
   0000  71       DIS         ; X = P = 0, so inits again (X,P) w/ zero
   0001  00                   ; and disables INT
   ...                        ; setup INT handling
         70       RET         ; enable INT
         xp

- interrupt routine
   SAVE     ; save T into stack pointed by X
   ...
   RET      ; return and IE
   or
   DIS      ; return and disable IE
