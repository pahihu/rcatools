=====

This is the beginning of a CDSII-CDP18S005 simulator.
For more information, check the "Operator Manual for 
the RCA COSMAC Development System II CDP18S005", MPM-216
manual.

The included `.sr' ASM source files can be assembled
with the included A18 assembler.

The fforth.sr and fforth.img disk file is from DW Schultz' 
MicroDOS package (http://davesrocketworks.com/electronics/1802/microdos/index.html). I have replaced the UT71 monitor calls with the original
UT20 calls found in http://www.forth.org/fig-forth/fig-forth_1802.pdf.

The original fig-FORTH uses the CD1854 UART on Group 1.
The CDP18S005 by default uses the UART on Group 2, although
the UT20 ROM does not include support for it (UT21 does).
Hence the -4 switch for the simulator to configure the
register display using the fig-FORTH virtual registers and
reconfigure the UART using Group 1 I/O.


To run fig-FORTH execute

        make ut20.rom fforth.idi
        ./fig

To run the original UT20 monitor

        make ut20.rom
        ./ut20
