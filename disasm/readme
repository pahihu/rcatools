Disassemble all:
1806 disassembler for the nokia ATF-2 carphone

disasm < nokia.hex > nokia.asm

Disassemble from 00e0h - 0fffh:
disasm -b00e0 -e0fff < nokia.hex > nokia.asm

Note that disassembling the whole rom at once will fail because the emty space in the eprom is filled with ff, and ff is a 2 bytes instruction. You will need to split up the dataspace in some parts.
